                <p>I am currently stressing out on college applications. I haven't finish any of the essays that are due November 1st and I was consciously avoiding talking about it. I am stressing out because my AP Seminar and Psychology both have a paper to write and I'm afraid I am not going to finish it on time haha. I am also applying to NYU Shanghai, please wish me good luck. I appreciate it very much if you can pat me on the back and say Lillian you got this. I need a lot of positivity in my senior life because we are constantly getting yelled by Ms.Boss every single day. Including the weekends.</p>
                <p>I am sorry that I just started writing this website hours before this assignment is due. I didn't mean to do it, I was doing Halloween preparation for STUCO and I also have to finish all my essays. Even though I still haven't finish any one of the essays, please don't grade this too harshly. I will try my best to finish this before the deadline. Now I'm just writing on this p to see whether this would work on the about me page. Hope you can learn more about Lillian as you progressed to look at the later pages. Thank you for taking time to read this long "short descroption," I wish you a happy weekend.</p>
